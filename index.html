                    Hello World !!!
                </h1>

                    Who am I ?
                </h3>
                <hr>
                <p>My name is Bhargav sai Dama. I found github pages interesting and creating one.
                As I am creating one, I thought might as well give my introduction also.
                After doing my Electrical Engineering, I realised that I am not much excited about the field and decided to become an
                software engineer (Thanks to Wipro).<br>
                I code in Python :) </p>
                <h3>
                    Areas of Interest
                </h3>
                <hr>
                <p> Many people say that Data is the new OIL and I am one among in who believes in that, this made me to think about Oil-mining aka Data science.
                I really want to learn and explore this field. With the technology out there and its usage, Wonders can be achieved (dreams dreams)
                Ahem !! <br>
                    I am also a movie buff. Love to watch movies which has meaning</p>
                <h3>
                    My projects
                </h3>
                <hr>
                <p>I have done a project on how GDP(developed countries) is affecting the medal count in Olympics using R language and of course there is always individual talent which is
                    an exception
                I am also learning machine learning algorithms and I want to implement AI to the stock data and also I am currently building a blog using Django to try and write lots of stuff.(This is like test case to that)<br><br>
                Professionally,
                    I was involved in banking projects mostly where we build and support applications using Django and dependencies and currently
                    I am working at Amex in developing parsers to their ETL workflow.</p>
